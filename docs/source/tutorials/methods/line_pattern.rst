Pre-processing techniques for a line-pattern image
==================================================

As lines in a calibration image are curved under radial distortion, using
well-known line-detection methods such as Hough transform-based approaches
are not always feasible. A simple method for detecting curved lines has been
developed for Discorpy 1.4 where points on each line are detected by locating
local extrema points on an intensity-profile generated by plotting across the
image (Fig. 1). Many intensity-profiles are generated to detect points on lines
at different locations, then they are grouped line-by-line (Fig. 2).
