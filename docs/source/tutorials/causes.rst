Causes of distortion
====================

In a lens-coupled camera or detector, there are two major types of distortion
which may often be seen in an acquired image: radial distortion and perspective
distortion (Fig. 1).

  (c) Radial distortion: pincushion type. (d) Perspective distortion.

**Radial distortion** is caused by the increase or decrease of the magnification of a
lens with respect to the radius from the optical axis as shown in Fig. 2.

**Perspective distortion** can be caused by two sources: a lens-plane is not parallel
to a camera-sensor plane, known as tangential distortion, (Fig. 3) and/or an
object-plane is not parallel to a camera-sensor plane (Fig. 4).
