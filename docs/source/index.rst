Discorpy's documentation
========================

Discorpy is an open-source Python package for radial distortion correction
with sub-pixel accuracy as required by tomography detector systems. It is used to
calculate parameters of a polynomial model of radial lens distortion, which are
the center of distortion and the polynomial coefficients, using a grid pattern
